******************************
Fledge South Person detection
******************************


This directory contains a South service plugin that a detects person in the live video stream 
and generates reading object with type of object (in this case it is  person), bounding box cordinates and confidence score.
The plugins also draws the bounding box on the detection window, and also displays confidence scores, 
FPS (Frames Per Second) & type of object detected (Person). 
In the reading the bounding box consists of {x,y} for top-left corner and bottom right corner of this rectangle. These coordinates
values are based on a 640x480 canvas.

-------------------------------
Plugin Configuration Parameters
-------------------------------

TFlite Model File:
        This is the name of the tflite model file that should be placed in
        python/fledge/plugins/south/person_detection/model directory. Its default value is detect_edgetpu.tflite.
        If a Coral Edge TPU is not being used, the file name will be different (i.e. detect.tflite).

Labels File:
        This is the name of the labels file that was used when training the above
        model, this file should also be placed in same directory as the model.

Asset Name:
        The name of the asset used for the readings generated by this plugin.

Enable Edge TPU:
        Indicates whether to use edge TPU for inference.
        If you don't want to use Coral Edge TPU then disbale this configuration parameter.
        Also ensure to change the name of the model file to detect.tflite if disabled.
        Default is set to enabled.

Minimum Confidence Threshold:
        The detection results from the model will be filtered out, if the score is below this value.

Source:
        Either use a stream over a network or use a local camera device.
        Default is set to stream.

Streaming URL:
        The URL of the RTSP stream, if stream is to be used. Only RTSP streams are supported for now.

OpenCV Backend:
        The backend required by OpenCV to process the stream, if stream is to be used.
        Default is set to ffmpeg.
Streaming Protocol:
        The protocol over which live frames are being transported over the network, if stream is to be used.
        Default is set to udp.

Camera ID:
        The number associated with your video device. See /dev in your filesystem you will see video0 or video1.
        It is required when source is set to camera.
        Default is set to 0.

Enable Detection Window:
        Show detection results in a native window.
        Default is set to disabled.

Enable Web Streaming:
        Whether to stream the detected results in a browser or not.
        Default is set to enabled.

Web Streaming Port:
        Port number where web streaming server should run, if web streaming is enabled.
        Default is set to 8085.

1. How to run this in virtual box installed in windows  machine ?

    Install virtual box extensions

    cd c:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\VirtualBox

    VBoxManage list webcams

    After obtaining the id of camera device  run this

    VboxManage controlvm "name_of_vm" webcam attach .id

    Example:

    VboxManage controlvm "new_ubuntu" webcam attach .1
